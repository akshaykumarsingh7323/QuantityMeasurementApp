Feet and Inches are treated as separate entities and compared independently.

## Objective

To validate and compare two Feet values and two Inches values using proper equality logic.

## Preconditions

4. `equals()` method is invoked
5. Values are compared using `Double.compare()`
6. Result (`true` / `false`) is returned

## Postcondition

Returns equality result for Feet-to-Feet and Inches-to-Inches comparisons.

## Key Concepts

## 📏 UC3 – Generic Quantity Class (DRY Principle)

## Description

UC3 refactors separate Feet and Inches classes into a single `QuantityLength` class using an enum.  
This eliminates code duplication and follows the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.

## Objective

To compare measurements across units (e.g., 1 ft == 12 inches) using a common base unit conversion.

## Preconditions

- `QuantityMeasurementApp` is instantiated
- Two numeric values with unit types are provided
- Conversion factors are defined in `LengthUnit` enum

## Main Flow

1. User provides value and unit
2. Input and unit are validated
3. Values are converted to base unit (feet)
4. Converted values are compared using `Double.compare()`
5. Equality result is returned

## Postcondition

Returns `true` if converted values are equal, otherwise `false`.  
All UC1 and UC2 functionality remains preserved.

## Key Concepts

- DRY Principle (no duplicate unit classes)
- Enum for type-safe units
- Cross-unit comparison (1 ft = 12 inches)
- Encapsulation and abstraction
- Equality contract and null safety
- Scalable design for adding new units

## Description

UC4 extends UC3 by adding YARDS and CENTIMETERS to the `LengthUnit` enum.  
The generic `QuantityLength` class now supports feet, inches, yards, and centimeters without code duplication.

## Objective

To compare measurements across multiple units (ft, in, yd, cm) using common base conversion.

## Preconditions

- Refactored `QuantityLength` class from UC3 is used
- Units supported: FEET, INCHES, YARDS, CENTIMETERS
- Conversion factors are defined in the enum

## Main Flow

1. User provides value and unit
2. Input and unit are validated
3. Values are converted to a common base unit
4. Converted values are compared using `Double.compare()`
5. Equality result is returned

## Postcondition

Returns `true` if converted values are equal across any unit combination.  
All UC1–UC3 functionality remains intact.

## Key Concepts

- Scalable generic design
- Enum extensibility
- Cross-unit conversion (1 yd = 3 ft = 36 in, 1 cm = 0.393701 in)
- DRY principle validation
- Mathematical accuracy in conversions
- Backward compatibility

## 📏 UC5 – Unit-to-Unit Conversion (Same Measurement Type)

## Description

UC5 extends UC4 by adding explicit unit-to-unit conversion functionality.

- Conversion factors are defined relative to a base unit

## Main Flow

1. Client calls `convert(value, sourceUnit, targetUnit)`
2. Validate value (finite number) and units (non-null)
3. Normalize value to base unit
4. Convert base value to target unit
5. Return converted numeric result

## Postcondition

Returns mathematically equivalent value in target unit.  
Invalid inputs throw `IllegalArgumentException`.

## Key Concepts

- Base unit normalization formula
- Immutability and value object design
- Method overloading and API usability
- Floating-point precision handling
- Bidirectional and round-trip conversion accuracy
- Clean, scalable conversion API

## UC6 – Addition of Two Length Units (Same Category)

## Description

UC6 extends UC5 by introducing addition between two length measurements.  
Two lengths (possibly different units) can be added, and the result is returned in the unit of the first operand.

## Objective

To add two QuantityLength objects using base unit normalization and return a new immutable result.

## Preconditions

- `QuantityLength` class and `LengthUnit` enum exist
- Units supported: FEET, INCHES, YARDS, CENTIMETERS
- Both operands belong to the same measurement category (length)

## Main Flow

1. Validate operands and units (non-null, finite values)
2. Convert both values to a common base unit
3. Add the normalized values
4. Convert the sum to the unit of the first operand
5. Return a new `QuantityLength` object

## Postcondition

Returns a new immutable object representing the sum.  
Original objects remain unchanged.  
Invalid inputs throw `IllegalArgumentException`.

## Key Concepts

- Arithmetic on value objects
- Base unit normalization for cross-unit addition
- Immutability and factory-style method design
- Commutative property (A + B = B + A)
- Identity element (adding zero)
- Precision handling with floating-point tolerance
- Reuse of conversion logic from UC5

## Description

UC7 extends UC6 by allowing the caller to explicitly specify the target unit for the addition result.  
The sum is returned in the chosen unit, not automatically inferred from operands.

3. Add normalized values
4. Convert sum to specified target unit
5. Return a new immutable `QuantityLength` object

## Postcondition

## Main Flow

1. `LengthUnit` provides `convertToBaseUnit()` and `convertFromBaseUnit()`
2. `QuantityLength` delegates conversion to unit methods
3. Equality, conversion, and addition use delegated logic
4. All UC1–UC7 functionality remains unchanged

## Postcondition

- Circular dependency risks are eliminated
- Backward compatibility is preserved

## Key Concepts

- Conversion and addition are mathematically accurate within epsilon
- Length and weight are incomparable categories
- All UC1–UC8 functionality remains unaffected

## Key Concepts

- Multiple measurement categories
