## ☁️ Production Deployment (EC2 + Docker)

The application is now production-ready for deployment using Docker on AWS EC2. All localhost assumptions have been removed and replaced with environment-driven configurations.

### Required Environment Variables

When running in production (`SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=prod`), the following environment variables MUST be set:

| Variable | Description | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE` | Set to `prod` for production behavior | `prod` |
| `APP_OAUTH2_REDIRECT_URI` | Frontend URL for OAuth2 redirect | `https://your-frontend-app.com/oauth2/redirect` |
| `APP_CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | Comma-separated allowed CORS origins | `https://app.com,https://api.app.com` |
| `DB_URL` | MySQL JDBC URL | `jdbc:mysql://db-host:3306/db_name` |
| `DB_USERNAME` | Database username | `admin` |
| `DB_PASSWORD` | Database password | `secret_password` |
| `REDIS_HOST` | Redis server hostname | `redis-cache` |
| `REDIS_PORT` | Redis server port (defaults to 6379) | `6379` |
| `APP_AUTH_TOKEN_SECRET` | JWT Signing Secret (Base64) | `openssl rand -base64 64` |

### Docker Deployment

**1. Build the Docker Image:**
```bash
docker build -t quantity-measurement-app .
```

**2. Run using Docker Compose:**
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Startup Validation
The application includes a `StartupConfigValidator` that checks for mandatory production settings. If any required environment variable is missing in the `prod` profile, the application will fail to start with a clear error message.
