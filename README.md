# Quantity Measurement App

## UC1 – Feet Measurement Equality

## Description

This use case checks the equality of two numerical values measured in feet using proper object-oriented design principles.

## Objective

To compare two feet measurements and return `true` if equal, otherwise `false`.

## Preconditions

- `Feet.java` is instantiated
- Two numeric values (in feet) are provided

## Main Flow

1. User provides two feet values
2. Objects of `Feet` class are created
3. `equals()` method is invoked
4. Values are compared using `Double.compare()`
5. Result is returned

## Postcondition

Returns `true` if both values are equal, otherwise `false`.

## Key Concepts

- Overriding `equals()` correctly
- Floating-point comparison using `Double.compare()`
- Null and type safety checks
- Encapsulation and immutability
- Equality contract (reflexive, symmetric, transitive, consistent)

## UC2 – Feet and Inches Measurement Equality

## Description

This use case extends UC1 to support equality checks for both Feet and Inches measurements.  
Feet and Inches are treated as separate entities and compared independently.

## Objective

To validate and compare two Feet values and two Inches values using proper equality logic.

## Preconditions

- `Inches.java` is instantiated
- Two numeric values for Feet and Inches are provided

## Main Flow

1. Main method calls static method for Feet equality
2. Main method calls static method for Inches equality
3. Separate `Feet` and `Inches` objects are created
4. `equals()` method is invoked
5. Values are compared using `Double.compare()`
6. Result (`true` / `false`) is returned

## Postcondition

Returns equality result for Feet-to-Feet and Inches-to-Inches comparisons.

## Key Concepts

- Object Equality and equals() contract
- Floating-point comparison using `Double.compare()`
- Null and type safety checks
- Encapsulation and immutability
- DRY principle consideration (code duplication in Feet & Inches classes)

## 📏 UC3 – Generic Quantity Class (DRY Principle)

## Description

UC3 refactors separate Feet and Inches classes into a single `QuantityLength` class using an enum.  
This eliminates code duplication and follows the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.

## Objective

To compare measurements across units (e.g., 1 ft == 12 inches) using a common base unit conversion.

## Preconditions

- `QuantityMeasurementApp` is instantiated
- Two numeric values with unit types are provided
- Conversion factors are defined in `LengthUnit` enum

## Main Flow

1. User provides value and unit
2. Input and unit are validated
3. Values are converted to base unit (feet)
4. Converted values are compared using `Double.compare()`
5. Equality result is returned

## Postcondition

Returns `true` if converted values are equal, otherwise `false`.  
All UC1 and UC2 functionality remains preserved.

## Key Concepts

- DRY Principle (no duplicate unit classes)
- Enum for type-safe units
- Cross-unit comparison (1 ft = 12 inches)
- Encapsulation and abstraction
- Equality contract and null safety
- Scalable design for adding new units
