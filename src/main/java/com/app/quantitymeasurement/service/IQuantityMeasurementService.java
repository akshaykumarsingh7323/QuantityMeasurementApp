/*
 * This interface defines the contract for the service layer in the Quantity Measurement
 * application. It provides the core business logic boundary for handling measurement operations
 * such as conversion, comparison, addition, subtraction, and division between different
 * physical quantities (e.g., Length, Weight, Volume, Temperature). Implementations of
 * this interface are responsible for validating the operations, calculating results,
 * and interacting with the repository layer to persist these measurement transactions.
